# Summary

AGLgis is an open-source QGIS plugin designed to simplify the preparation and analysis of Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Backscatter data using Google Earth Engine (GEE). The plugin provides a graphical interface for configuring and running the [ee-s1-ard](https://pypi.org/project/ee-s1-ard/) package, enabling users to process SAR data without writing code. Key features include area selection, date range configuration, border noise correction, terrain flattening, speckle filtering, and export of analysis-ready results. AGLgis aims to make advanced SAR data workflows accessible to a broader geospatial community, supporting research and operational applications in remote sensing.

# Statement of Need

Sentinel-1 SAR data is widely used in earth observation for applications such as land cover mapping, flood monitoring, and agricultural analysis. However, preparing analysis-ready SAR data typically requires complex processing steps and programming expertise. AGLgis addresses this gap by integrating the [ee-s1-ard] package into QGIS, providing a user-friendly interface for non-programmers and researchers to access advanced SAR processing capabilities. The plugin streamlines workflows, reduces barriers to entry, and promotes reproducible research in geospatial science.

# Features

- Graphical interface for area, date, and parameter selection
- Direct integration with Google Earth Engine and the [ee-s1-ard] package
- Support for border noise correction, terrain flattening, and speckle filtering
- Export of results in analysis-ready formats

# Implementation

AGLgis is implemented in Python and leverages QGIS's PyQt framework for the user interface. The plugin communicates with Google Earth Engine via the [ee-s1-ard] package, handling authentication, data selection, and processing. Users can install the plugin in QGIS and follow the documentation for setup and usage.
