# Summary

AGLgis is an open-source QGIS plugin [@qgis] designed to simplify the preparation and analysis of Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Backscatter data [@sentinel1] using Google Earth Engine (GEE) [@earthengine]. The plugin provides a graphical interface for configuring and running the [ee-s1-ard](https://pypi.org/project/ee-s1-ard/) package [@ees1ard], which implements the data processing workflow described by Mullissa et al. (2021) [@mullissa2021], enabling users to process SAR data without writing code. Key features include area selection, date range configuration, border noise correction, terrain flattening, speckle filtering, and export of analysis-ready results. AGLgis aims to make advanced SAR data workflows accessible to a broader geospatial community, supporting research and operational applications in remote sensing.

# Statement of Need

Sentinel-1 SAR data [@sentinel1] is widely used in earth observation for applications such as land cover mapping, flood monitoring, and agricultural analysis. However, preparing analysis-ready SAR data typically requires complex processing steps and programming expertise. AGLgis addresses this gap by integrating the [ee-s1-ard] package [@ees1ard] into QGIS [@qgis], providing a user-friendly interface for non-programmers and researchers to access advanced SAR processing capabilities. The plugin streamlines workflows, reduces barriers to entry, and promotes reproducible research in geospatial science [@earthengine].

# Features

AGLgis offers a user-friendly graphical interface for configuring and running Sentinel-1 SAR data processing workflows in QGIS. Key capabilities include:

- Area of interest and date range selection
- Integration with Google Earth Engine and the [ee-s1-ard] package
- Automated border noise correction, terrain flattening, and speckle filtering
- Interactive visualization of VV/VH time series and RGB composites within QGIS
- Direct download of processed bands for selected dates
- Batch download of multiple processed scenes

All major processing parameters—geometry, temporal range, polarization (VV, VH, or VVVH), and correction options—are accessible via the plugin’s GUI. Sensible defaults (VVVH polarization and all corrections enabled) help users quickly obtain analysis-ready SAR data.

# Demonstration

The figure below demonstrates the main results generated by AGLgis:

- Interactive time series visualization of backscatter values (VV/VH) for the selected area.
- RGB view of the most recent processed Sentinel-1 scene.

# Implementation

AGLgis is implemented in Python and leverages QGIS's PyQt framework for the user interface [@pyqt]. The plugin communicates with Google Earth Engine [@earthengine] (which requires authenticatin and a Google Cloud Project) and applies the  [ee-s1-ard] package [@ees1ard], handling data selection, and processing. Users can install the plugin in QGIS and follow the documentation for setup and usage.
